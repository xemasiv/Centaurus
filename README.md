Highly extendable, context-based web workers.

### Backstory:
I was looking for a way to do the following:

* Easily instantiate web workers
* Easily load multiple scripts
* Easily pass functions for these workers
* Easily call passed functions from web worker itself
* Easily access function arguments in the web worker
* Easily turn all web worker functions into promises
* Easily chain all actions from web worker

Ended up writing this library.
End of story.
